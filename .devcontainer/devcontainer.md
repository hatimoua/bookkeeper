The "Dev Container" extension is a nice way to encapsulate your code -- if you have docker installed on your machine you can do all of your development in a container which helps teams ensure they're working in the same environment, better mirrors a linux deployed container/server, and helps avoid accidentally mixing host machine packages/versions/environments with your venv or other projects.
