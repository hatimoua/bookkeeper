Bank reconciliations are performed monthly to ensure accuracy between the GL balance and bank statement balance."
Bank savings account,1010,Balance sheet,Current assets,Debit,"Interest-bearing savings account used to hold excess cash reserves, emergency funds, or temporarily park surplus operating funds not immediately needed for day-to-day business operations. Earns interest income on deposited balances while maintaining high liquidity and easy access to funds. Common uses include setting aside money for upcoming tax payments, building working capital reserves, saving for planned capital expenditures, accumulating funds for seasonal cash flow fluctuations, or earning returns on idle cash between major business expenses. Interest earned is taxable income reported on T2 corporate tax return or personal income tax for sole proprietors. May include high-interest savings accounts (HISA), money market accounts, or term deposits with flexible withdrawal terms."
Petty cash account,1030,Balance sheet,Current assets,Debit,"Small amount of physical cash kept on business premises in a locked cash box or safe for minor day-to-day expenses that are impractical to pay by cheque, credit card, or electronic transfer. Typically maintained at a fixed amount (e.g., $100-$500) using an imprest system where the fund is periodically replenished. Common petty cash expenses include emergency office supplies, coffee and snacks for meetings, parking meter coins, postage stamps, taxi fares, courier tips, small equipment repairs under $50, emergency lunch for staff working late, minor cleaning supplies, and spontaneous small purchases. Requires proper documentation with receipts and petty cash vouchers for each disbursement to maintain accountability and support tax deductions. Reconciled regularly by counting cash on hand plus receipts to equal the fixed fund amount. All disbursements must have valid business purposes to be tax-deductible."
Accounts receivable,1200,Balance sheet,Current assets,Debit,"Money owed to the business by customers and clients for goods sold or services provided on credit terms. Represents outstanding customer invoices that have been issued but payment has not yet been received. Includes trade receivables from normal business operations with payment terms typically ranging from net 15, net 30, to net 60 days. Also includes unpaid sales invoices, service billings, progress billings for ongoing projects, and any other amounts due from customers. This account increases when sales are made on credit and decreases when customer payments are received and deposited. Proper management requires aging analysis to track overdue invoices, follow-up on late payments, and identify collection issues. Should be reviewed regularly for potentially uncollectible accounts that may need to be written off or provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Important metric for calculating days sales outstanding (DSO) and monitoring cash flow from operations. For GST/HST purposes, tax may be owing even before customer payment is received."
Allowance for doubtful debts account,1210,Balance sheet,Current assets,Credit,"Contra-asset account that estimates the portion of accounts receivable that may not be collectible due to customer defaults, bankruptcies, disputes, or financial difficulties. Reduces the net realizable value of accounts receivable on the balance sheet to reflect a more realistic expected collection amount. Created through bad debt expense entries based on historical collection experience, aging analysis of receivables, assessment of specific customer credit risks, and general economic conditions affecting payment likelihood. Methods include percentage of sales method, percentage of receivables method, or aging schedule analysis. When specific accounts are determined to be uncollectible, they are written off against this allowance rather than directly reducing revenue. This follows the matching principle and conservatism principle in accounting by recognizing potential losses in the period the revenue was earned rather than waiting until actual default occurs. Required under ASPE and IFRS to present accounts receivable at net realizable value. Reviewed and adjusted quarterly or annually."
Inventory,1400,Balance sheet,Current assets,Debit,"Goods and products held by the business for sale to customers, including finished goods ready for sale, work-in-progress partially completed, raw materials to be used in production, and supplies consumed in the manufacturing process.

Must be valued at lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV) per Canadian ASPE Section 3031 or IAS 2 under IFRS. Physical inventory counts performed periodically (usually annually) to verify quantities and identify shrinkage from theft, damage, or obsolescence.
